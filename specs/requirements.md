# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) application provides automated document analysis capabilities through a web interface. Users can upload documents to extract text via OCR, classify document types, and generate summaries. The system processes documents through a sequential pipeline and stores results in a flexible database schema.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Document Upload Interface
**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload documents through a simple web interface, so that I can process them through the IDP pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user accesses the web application THE SYSTEM SHALL display a clean upload interface
2. WHEN a user selects a document file THE SYSTEM SHALL validate the file type and size
3. WHEN a user uploads a document THE SYSTEM SHALL store it in AWS S3 and trigger the processing pipeline
4. WHEN a document upload fails THE SYSTEM SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 2: OCR Text Extraction
**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to extract text from uploaded documents, so that I can access structured content data.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a document is uploaded THE SYSTEM SHALL perform OCR to extract text content
2. WHEN OCR processing completes THE SYSTEM SHALL format results as key-value pairs in JSON format
3. WHEN OCR encounters markdown-wrapped JSON THE SYSTEM SHALL handle it correctly
4. WHEN OCR processing fails THE SYSTEM SHALL log errors and continue to next pipeline stage

### Requirement 3: Document Classification
**User Story:** As a user, I want documents to be automatically classified, so that I can organize and filter content by type.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN OCR extraction completes THE SYSTEM SHALL classify the document into predefined categories
2. WHEN classification runs THE SYSTEM SHALL use these categories: Dietary Supplement, Stationery, Kitchen Supplies, Medicine, Driver License, Invoice, W2, Other
3. WHEN classification completes THE SYSTEM SHALL store the predicted category with confidence score
4. WHEN classification fails THE SYSTEM SHALL default to "Other" category

### Requirement 4: Document Summarization
**User Story:** As a user, I want automatic document summaries, so that I can quickly understand document content without reading the full text.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN document classification completes THE SYSTEM SHALL generate a concise summary
2. WHEN summarization runs THE SYSTEM SHALL create summaries appropriate for the document type
3. WHEN summarization completes THE SYSTEM SHALL store the summary text
4. WHEN summarization fails THE SYSTEM SHALL store an error message

### Requirement 5: Results Storage and Display
**User Story:** As a user, I want to view processing results in the web interface, so that I can access extracted data, classifications, and summaries.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN all pipeline tasks complete THE SYSTEM SHALL store results in a flexible schema database
2. WHEN results are available THE SYSTEM SHALL display OCR data, classification, and summary in the UI
3. WHEN a user refreshes the page THE SYSTEM SHALL show updated processing status
4. WHEN processing is incomplete THE SYSTEM SHALL show progress indicators

### Requirement 6: End-to-End Processing Validation
**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate the complete pipeline with sample data, so that I can ensure all components work together correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the system is deployed THE SYSTEM SHALL successfully process the sample image from the images folder
2. WHEN end-to-end testing runs THE SYSTEM SHALL complete OCR, classification, and summarization
3. WHEN testing completes THE SYSTEM SHALL display all results correctly in the frontend
4. WHEN the development server starts THE SYSTEM SHALL launch the webapp successfully
